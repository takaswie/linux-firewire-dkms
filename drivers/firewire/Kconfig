	  IEEE 1394 describes a high performance serial bus, which is also
	  known as FireWire(tm) or i.Link(tm) and is used for connecting all
	  sorts of devices (most notably digital video cameras) to your
	  computer.

	  If you have FireWire hardware and want to use it, say Y here.  This
	  is the core support only, you will also need to select a driver for
	  your IEEE 1394 adapter.

	  This is the "JUJU" firewire stack, an alternative
	  implementation designed for roboustness and simplicity.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called fw-core.
