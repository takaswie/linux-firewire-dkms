comment "An alternative FireWire stack is available with EXPERIMENTAL=y"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL=n

config FIREWIRE
	tristate "IEEE 1394 (FireWire) support (JUJU alternative stack, experimental)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  IEEE 1394 describes a high performance serial bus, which is also
	  known as FireWire(tm) or i.Link(tm) and is used for connecting all
	  sorts of devices (most notably digital video cameras) to your
	  computer.

	  If you have FireWire hardware and want to use it, say Y here.  This
	  is the core support only, you will also need to select a driver for
	  your IEEE 1394 adapter.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the module will be
	  called fw-core.

	  This is the "JUJU" FireWire stack, an alternative implementation
	  designed for robustness and simplicity.  You can build either this
	  stack, or the classic stack (the ieee1394 driver, ohci1394 etc.)
	  or both.

config FIREWIRE_OHCI
	tristate "Support for OHCI FireWire host controllers"
	depends on PCI && FIREWIRE
	help
	  Enable this driver if you have a FireWire controller based
	  on the OHCI specification.  For all practical purposes, this
	  is the only chipset in use, so say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be
	  called fw-ohci.

	  If you also build ohci1394 of the classic IEEE 1394 driver stack,
	  blacklist either ohci1394 or fw-ohci to let hotplug load the desired
	  driver.

config FIREWIRE_SBP2
	tristate "Support for storage devices (SBP-2 protocol driver)"
	depends on FIREWIRE && SCSI
	help
	  This option enables you to use SBP-2 devices connected to a
	  FireWire bus.  SBP-2 devices include storage devices like
	  harddisks and DVD drives, also some other FireWire devices
	  like scanners.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here:  The module will be
	  called fw-sbp2.

	  You should also enable support for disks, CD-ROMs, etc. in the SCSI
	  configuration section.

	  If you also build sbp2 of the classic IEEE 1394 driver stack,
	  blacklist either sbp2 or fw-sbp2 to let hotplug load the desired
	  driver.
