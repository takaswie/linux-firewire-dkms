comment "An alternative FireWire stack is available with EXPERIMENTAL=y"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL=n

	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  IEEE 1394 describes a high performance serial bus, which is also
	  known as FireWire(tm) or i.Link(tm) and is used for connecting all
	  sorts of devices (most notably digital video cameras) to your
	  computer.

	  If you have FireWire hardware and want to use it, say Y here.  This
	  is the core support only, you will also need to select a driver for
	  your IEEE 1394 adapter.

	  This is the "JUJU" FireWire stack, an alternative
	  implementation designed for robustness and simplicity.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called fw-core.

config FW_OHCI
	tristate "Support for OHCI FireWire host controllers"
	depends on PCI && FW
	help
	  Enable this driver if you have a FireWire controller based
	  on the OHCI specification.  For all practical purposes, this
	  is the only chipset in use, so say Y here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, say M here: the
	  module will be called fw-ohci.

config FW_SBP2
	tristate "Support for storage devices (SBP-2 protocol driver)"
	depends on FW && SCSI
	help
	  This option enables you to use SBP-2 devices connected to a
	  FireWire bus.  SBP-2 devices include storage devices like
	  harddisks and DVD drives, also some other FireWire devices
	  like scanners.

	  You should also enable support for disks, CD-ROMs, etc. in the SCSI
	  configuration section.
